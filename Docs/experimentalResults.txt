Experimental results & Hadoop justification.


<<INSERT RESULTS>>

Hadoop was necessary for us because of the sheer size of our data set. The operations
we conducted caused the data set to increase in size at an O(n^2) rate. For us, this
means that reading through all the books would be impossible to complete on a single
machine. In fact, according to our calculations, using the current cluster to parse
through 35,000 books (the original data set), it would take 240 days to complete.
